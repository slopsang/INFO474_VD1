<b>Visualization Design #1 - antibiotics_data</b><br>
The purpose of this data visualization is to improve my ability to leverage visual encodings. Quantitative messages always reveal relationships, and it's these relationships that tell the great stories that deserve attention. Throughout this assignment, I will answer specific questions about a dataset of different bacteria and antibiotics by using Plotly JavaScript API. I will also defense my design choices in depth by explaining why my visual encodings are appropriate to answer specific questions and how my decisions facilitate effective communication.
